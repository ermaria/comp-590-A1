For this assignment I chose to expand the target game, and I added a scoreboard and gave the player 10 clicks to try and achieve the highest score possible. this makes the app into more of a game in the sense of how we discussed it in class because it now has an objective (achieve the highest possible score in 10 chances). it also now has a (very linited) ruleset, that you only have ten chances to try and hit the target and then the game ends. It has variable and quantafiable outcomes and the user is hopefully invested in achieving the highest possible score.
